  The easiest way to generate a new color scheme is to simply set a base color here.  
  The color scheme is generated below based on relative values, and implemented 
  throughout. You can obviously tweak that below, or go through and set your colors 
  for each element by hand, but I've tried to set this up to give you a quick idea 
  of how different colors might work for your content. Tends to work better when a 
  rich color is used, as the scheme is created by adding and subtracting various 
  amounts of gray to the base.

  Some other fun base colors to try:
  fancy blue - #034569
  lime green - #4E9600
  ruby red - #A60C00
  bright pink - #CE0071
  royal purple - #45036F
  mustard plug - #A67000

// Set a basic color scheme

//Base color
!base = #888

//Color scheme
!darkest = !base - #888
!darker = !base - #555
!dark = !base - #222
!medium = #A6A7A9
!light = #D2D3D6
!lighter = !base + #666
!lightest = !base + #888


// Apply color scheme to elements

//Body elements
!body = #fff
!topBar = #fff
!logo = #4C4D56
!tabs = !medium
!tabLink = !lightest
!wrapper = #fff
!contentBox = #fff

//Typography
!h1 = !darkest
!h2 = !darkest
!h3 = !darker
!h4 = !darkest
!text = !darkest

!link = #111

//Border used on content box, pagination, etc.
!border = #D2D3D6
=borderThin
  :border = "1px solid" !border


// Error and Flash Messages

//Error messages
!error = #F5D1C4
!red = #ee1111
!errorText = #FF0000

//Alert messages
!alert = #fbf7b1

//Success messages
!success = #98F395

//Flash message color scheme
=flash(!flashColor, !flashImage)
  :background = !flashColor
  :border-color = !flashColor - #666
  #close
    :background = !flashColor - #666
    :border-color = !flashColor - #999
    :color = !flashColor - #999
    &:hover
      :background = !flashColor
  .message
    :background = "url('/images/icons/" + !flashImage + ".png') no-repeat center left"
